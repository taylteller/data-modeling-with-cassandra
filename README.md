# Data Modeling with Cassandra

A (fictional) music company named Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

They'd like a data engineer to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions. This project consists of the creation of a database for this analysis. 

The data is modeled based on the queries that are intended to be run. Part of the ETL pipeline was provided and had to be completed. This pipeline transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables.

This project is part of the Udacity Data Engineering nanodegree.
